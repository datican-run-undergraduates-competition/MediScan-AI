## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mediscan-ai.git
cd mediscan-ai
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables (create a .env file)
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key

## API Documentation

MediScan AI provides a comprehensive API for:
- User management and authentication
- Medical image upload and analysis
- Report generation and management

Full API documentation is available via Swagger UI at `/docs` endpoint.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit .env files to version control

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Use a proper reverse proxy like Nginx
   - Enable HTTPS with strong cipher suites
   - Consider using a web application firewall (WAF)

3. **User Management**
   - Always enforce strong passwords
   - Enable 2FA for all users with sensitive access
   - Regularly audit user access logs
